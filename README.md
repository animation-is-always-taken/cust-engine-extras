# cust-engine-extras
the texture pack for the cust engine and the files to make it work with geyser (uses files from [the geyser optional pack](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserOptionalPack))

this works with all branches of the cust engine

# Installation 
for the java resource pack it's just dropping it in %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks like every other resource pack

to install it on geyser you have to compress the "cust's resources bedrock" folder as a zip and then rename it to "geyser_resources.mcpack" (no quotes, no .zip at the end) and put that on *your geyser folder*/packs
