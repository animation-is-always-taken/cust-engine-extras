# cust-engine-extras
the texture pack for the cust engine and the files to make it work with geyser

this works with all branches of the cust engine

# Installation 
for the java resource pack it's just dropping it in %appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks like every other resources

to install it on geyser you have to put the geyser_resources.mcpack in *your geyser folder*/packs and geyser_mappings.json in the custom_mappings folder
